# Assignment7Test
This is the 7th. assignment for PBA Test spring2019soft

*All the setter and getters I would normally implement using the shorthand: public fieldName {get; set;}*

*I have taken some freedom with the returnvalues of some of the method, most of the setter-methods I have changed to return a bool, to indicate whether a value actually got set or not. I.E. Account.setId(-1) will return false, to indicate invalid method call*

*Each test file have been assigned 2 categories, that it belong to - the overall category; unit-test, integration-test or e2e-test. The 2nd category is its own private category, this one is mainly inthere to make it easy to target a single file/class for testing while developing*
